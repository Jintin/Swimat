## Installation

There are three way to install.

1. Install via [homebrew-cask](https://caskroom.github.io/)

  ```bash
  brew cask install swimat
  ```

2. Download the App directly.<br>
  <https://github.com/Jintin/Swimat/releases/download/v1.5.1/Swimat.zip>

3. Clone and archive to Mac App by yourself.

## Usage

**After installation, you should open the `Swimat.app` once to make the functionality works.**

In the Xcode menu click **[Editor] -> [Swimat] -> [Format]** then the current active file will reformat.

You can also create a hot-key in **[Xcode] -> [Preferences..] -> [Key Bindings]**, if you don't have any prefernce you can set as <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⇧</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd>.

## TroubleShooting

Check [System Preferences] -> [Extensions] -> [Xcode Source Editor] -> [Swimat] is checked. ![](./README/setting.png)
